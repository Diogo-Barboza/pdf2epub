## 🛠️ Dependencies

### System Dependencies (for native execution)
- **[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)** (v3.x recommended)
  - macOS: `brew install pandoc`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install pandoc`
  - Windows: `winget install JohnMacFarlane.Pandoc`
  *(Note: Pandoc is already pre-installed inside the official Docker image).*

### Python Dependencies
- Python 3.10–3.14 (3.13 recommended, see below)
- PyTorch (with CUDA/ROCm support for GPU acceleration)
- marker-pdf==1.10.2
- Pillow
- regex

### ⚠️ Python version

Python 3.13 is recommended.

`marker-pdf` constrains `Pillow<11.0.0`, and Pillow only ships Python 3.14
wheels from 11.3.0 onward. On Python 3.10–3.13 every dependency installs as a
prebuilt wheel. On 3.14, pip has to build Pillow from source instead: this
works, but it is slower and requires a working C toolchain plus the image
library headers Pillow links against. On Debian/Ubuntu install them first:

```bash
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libtiff-dev libfreetype6-dev libwebp-dev
```

Without these headers the install fails with
`RequiredDependencyException: The headers or library files could not be found for jpeg`.

## 💻 Installation

1. Install system dependencies (if running natively without Docker):
   - **macOS:** `brew install pandoc`
   - **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install pandoc`
   - **Windows:** `winget install JohnMacFarlane.Pandoc`

2. Create and activate a virtual environment.

On Linux/Mac:
```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```powershell
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install Python dependencies (this installs PyTorch as well):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. GPU acceleration (optional):

PyTorch is installed as a dependency in step 3. On Apple Silicon that wheel
already supports MPS, so no further action is needed. For a specific CUDA or
ROCm build, reinstall PyTorch using the selector at
[pytorch.org/get-started/locally](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
For example, for AMD GPUs with ROCm:
```bash
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.2
```

5. Verify GPU support:
```python
import torch
print(torch.__version__)  # PyTorch version
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  # Should return True for NVIDIA
print(torch.backends.mps.is_available())  # Should return True for Apple Silicon
print(torch.version.hip)  # Should print ROCm version for AMD
```

### 🐳 Docker

A CPU-only image can be built from the included `Dockerfile` (which includes Pandoc):

```bash
docker build -t pdf2epub .
```

Run it with your PDFs mounted at `/data` and a model cache volume (marker-pdf
downloads its models on first run):

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)":/data \
  -v pdf2epub-models:/models \
  pdf2epub input.pdf
```

`-it` is optional: if an interactive TTY is attached, you can customize the title and author during EPUB compilation; in headless/background execution, sensible defaults extracted by marker-pdf are applied automatically.

Tagged releases are also published to
`ghcr.io/overcuriousity/pdf2epub` by the Docker workflow.

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

Convert a single PDF file:
```bash
python main.py input.pdf
```

Convert all PDFs in a directory:
```bash
python main.py input_directory/
```

When running in an interactive terminal, EPUB generation prompts to confirm or customize metadata (title and author; press Enter to accept defaults). In headless or non-interactive environments, default metadata extracted from the document is used automatically. Use `--skip-epub` to produce only markdown without compiling to EPUB.

### Advanced Options

```bash
python main.py [input_path] [output_path] [options]

Options:
  --max-pages INT          Maximum number of pages to process
  --start-page INT         Page number to start from
  --skip-epub              Skip EPUB generation, only create markdown
  --skip-md                Skip markdown generation, use existing markdown files
```

If `input_path` is omitted, all PDFs in `./input/` are processed.

### Examples

Process a specific range of pages:
```bash
python main.py book.pdf --start-page 10 --max-pages 50
```

Convert to markdown only:
```bash
python main.py thesis.pdf --skip-epub
```
